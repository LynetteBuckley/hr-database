# HR Database

This project showcases a custom-designed HR database schema, created to reflect realistic organizational structures and HR operations. I developed it after exploring publicly available datasets and finding none that fully met my needs.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Designed schema includes employees / contractors, departments, roles, compensation, and reporting relationships
- Graphical org chart created in Word, reflecting real-world intranet-style presentation
- Mermaid-based org chart for GitHub-native visualization
- Expanded from a downloaded base schema (credited below) to better reflect HR systems I’ve worked with

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a database administrator and data modeler actively refreshing my skills, I wanted a realistic, flexible HR schema to use for learning, modeling, and future ETL practice. This project is part of my broader portfolio development and job search preparation.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- ERD to be created using Erwin Data Modeler
- Python ETL scripts to load data into a data warehouse
- Additional documentation and modeling decisions to be added

## 🔗 Source Acknowledgment

This project was inspired by the sample database provided by [SQL Tutorial Sample Database](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/). I expanded the schema and organizational structure to better reflect HR systems I’ve worked with during my professional career.
